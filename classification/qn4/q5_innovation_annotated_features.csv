"Paired this stand with my New 43"" TV, as the stands that came with the TV almost barely fit on the dresser where it is perched.

"Bought the OFFO Metal Zip Ties Cutter for Stainless Steel Tie Wrap, to use with metal zip ties and having the lever on the side for cutting the ties was a big plus for me.

"I don't like to give bad reviews but this one is just way too bad I felt the other buyers on Amazon should know so they can purchase a different drive.<br />To start with, I never had a flash drive get as hot as this one and I have many other drives both old and new and different capacities some plastic some metal.  I fear the heat will kill it sooner than any other drive. The reason it gets so hot is because the components inside are being clocked at a speed that is too high, much higher than they were designed to handle.  They are being overclocked.  What is strange is that even so, this drive is actually very slow compared to other drives that are said to have a speed over 100MB per second.  For very large files the top speed was 35MB per second and I could live with that,  but for a group of small files the speed drops to a mere 2MB per second. Yes, that is a 2 not  20.  So if you transfer a 200 MB file it might take 10 seconds, but if you transfer 1000 200k files it would take 100 seconds if you are lucky, and that's still a total of 200MB.  This means it may work for you if you only use it for large files unless it burns itself out due to the intense self heating. You also don't want to touch it right away let it cool before pulling it out of the USB connector, and while you are waiting search for a better drive on Amazon.<br />Note:<br />I use Crystal Disk Mark for speed test results but also do manually timed file copy and paste operations to back those results up with real world usage results.<br />Also note I have other SanDisk drives that work reasonably well.",0.44897469878196716,-0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0

"This is a step up from a previous dock that I had as it lets me run multiple monitors (2 in my case: 1x 27"" and 1x 24"") at 4K resolution.  A prior poster mentioned he had to run his monitors at refresh rate of 30hz, and while I was able to run one at 30 and one at 60, I was noticing significant lag and delays with the mouse (wired, wireless, or touchpad didn't matter) that only happened when connected to the dock.  Dropping the one monitor from 60hz to 30hz solved the issue.  This dock has otherwise been great, making it very easy to connect and disconnect my laptop.

"Overall, this product is as advertised and mine arrived with no defects. I love having a wide variety of ports as well as enough of each to plug in everything I need to.  However it is not able to support high refresh rates despite having the correct ports which is why it only gets 4/5 stars. My display is a 165hz UHD gaming monitor and I only get 60hz when plugged into the docking station so I have to plug the monitor in directly to the laptop. Minor inconvenience but something to note. In addition, power delivery is too weak for my primary laptop (Dell 5550) but enough for my work laptop (Lenovo ThinkPad T14). It does the trick for an affordable dock especially considering most alternatives cost more than double. If you really need better power delivery and high refresh rates for gaming, you may want to consider a more expensive option. If you're looking for an affordable option to keep cables organized and avoid plugging and unplugging a bunch of cables, this may be a good option.",0.4504256546497345,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0

"The Insta360 Link is likely the Best Webcam I‚Äôve ever used. Though I have never used another gimbal-based camera, it is truly a quality webcam with some pretty slick features.  Over the course of the past week or so, I‚Äôve been using the Insta360 Link to record videos, and have video calls through Skype and Zoom. I also wanted to test it as a second camera angle for use during my live stream which I‚Äôll get into as well.<br /><br />Upon unboxing the Link, I plugged it in using the included (maybe 3-foot long) USB-C to USB-C cable and it quickly installed the drivers and I was up and running. Unlike other cameras that I‚Äôve used that had a shorter cable, this one seemed like the perfect length to not only use with a laptop but have enough length when using with a desktop setup located on the floor. Obviously if you needed to put the camera at a longer distance, you could pick up a cable from one of the popular manufacturers here on Amazon.<br /><br />First off, as I mentioned, there are a number of slick features that combine the flexibility of the gimbal-based hardware with the power of the Insta360 software. Besides the things that you would expect in a webcam like auto exposure, auto-white balance, etc, the Link offers a really novel usage of A.I. motion tracking with gesture control to enable or modify certain features.<br /><br />When enabled in the app, hold up your hand and the LED light on the webcam flashes from its normal Green to Blue to indicate that motion tracking is turned on. You can also do this by simply single tapping on the front of the camera base and then tap again to turn it off. I gotta say, this is a nice implementation to toggle the gesture control feature on and off.<br /><br />There are three modes that you can modify in the app including Normal (default), Fast and Slow. During my usage, I pretty much stuck with either Normal or Slow as I think fast could make people on the other side of your video call a little nauseous. If you think you will be moving around at a normal speed, then Normal is perfect. However, if you only plan on making small movements, use the slow setting. The camera did a great job to track and follow me, pretty much without any lag.<br /><br />There are two other gestures that you can use including holding your left hand up in the shape of an L to enable zoom. While holding your hand in that position, either raise or lower the ‚ÄúL‚Äù to zoom in or out, respectively. It works pretty well but it worked a little better when I was located 3-4 feet away from the camera vs when I had my laptop on my lap. There is also a whiteboard mode that you can enable by making the ‚ÄúV‚Äù gesture with your hand. I tried it and it turned on the mode but since I don‚Äôt have a whiteboard, couldn‚Äôt really test this feature.<br /><br />There are a few other modes that you can enable in the app including a slight downward angle which is good if you are trying to capture an image of your keyboard or something right in front of the monitor. There is also a true ‚Äúoverhead‚Äù view that would be incredibly handy if you had the proper setup to utilize this mode. I definitely have to play with this one more. I believe that Insta360 offers a specific extendable tripod for the camera that can be screwed into the quarter-20 thread on the bottom.<br /><br />Overall, the color and brightness is good and sharp, especially in a properly lit scene. If you are using a ring light or something like the Elgato Key Light, Godox ES45 or the Boling P1 Vlogger, this camera will shine and make you look fantastic. If you are using the camera in a darker environment, you may have to tweak the brightness to your liking. I had to bump it up by 6 or 7 notches in the app to get it where I was happy. Again, in a bright setting, the HDR looked great but it was a bit too dark for my taste when the lights were turned off. I think this is more of a function of HDR vs the way the camera handles it.<br /><br />As I mentioned, I‚Äôm also a live streamer, so I wanted to see if it would work with my current setup. I personally use a software called VMix and it did struggle a bit with the video, making it look a little jumpy. I THINK this is more of a problem with VMix since the other 2 or 3 webcam‚Äôs I‚Äôve tried also faced the same issue. When I opened up OBS, and added the Link as a camera source, the video was smooth as normal. I‚Äôd love to see Insta360 contact VMix to see if some optimization could be done.<br /><br />Final Thoughts: I REALLY like this webcam and think it would make a great addition for anyone that is constantly on conference calls, especially if you tend to move around a bit. Comparing to the video in my Dell XPS 15 laptop and it truly not a fair fight. Exposure, color and the ability to enable motion tracking are all really well done.",0.4495766758918762,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.5

"I searched high and low for this desktop computer. I first saw a similar pc on Woot, but unfortunately, it was a disaster, the unit came missing accessories and worse damage. The worst part of the experience was the seller has the monopoly of Lenovo refurbs on Woot, Amazon, Tanga and ebay. So, when I saw Tekrefurbs, a small family outfit, I was delighted and thus, they did not disappoint. The best part of the purchase, free shipping and a lesser price than elsewhere. It is a refurb so I do expect scratches and dents, not a problem. Furthermore, it was a breeze to set up and as a work from home person, I was able to purchase a gadget to attach two monitors. The version of windows 10  installed is the most current version so  old Logitech wireless mouse and keyboard may not be compatible with the windows 10 software installed. Moreover, the unit is lightening fast in accessing files and browsing the internet. Luckily, the desktop unit came with a wired mouse and keyboard. To be honest, I was surprised to find that wired mouse and keyboard are still around in this day and age. Suffice it to say, they both serve my needs. So if you are living on a work from home budget, then this desktop is for you. I do recommend Lenovo units, this is my second unit purchased and as soon as disposable funds become available I will be purchasing one of the i7 units for my personal use.<br />PS.

"Don't let the description fool you, like it did me.  These are not bone conduction; there are super tiny ""directional"" speakers at the top of the ear pieces.  I tested them with some music and didn't last a full song.  I've picked up dollar store headphones with better sound quality than these.  No depth whatsoever, just sounds like you're listening to music in a tin can.  As far as the fit goes, I did find them rather comfortable.  However, I sit stationary at a desk most of the day so there isn't many chances for them to fall off.  The microphone does not move, which I'm not a fan of.

Installation was not very difficult and I managed to get it connected to the existing AP. It does not work very effectively as an extender and the signal was barely any stronger than the master AP.

I have very small ears and cannot use normal earbuds .. no matter the brand or price. This one is amazing. It nestles into your ear without going into the canal. It does not budge. The sound isn't the best on the planet but it's not bad .. especially since it's only one ear. This is perfect for the work or school setting. You can listen to whatever you're streaming and still hear what's going on around you. Highly recommend if you haven't been able to find a comfortable earbud.,0.4473989009857178,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"The cable is nice and flexible kind of rubber which is a big advantage over other earbuds at this price point which have cables that get all deformed and stiff after being too hot or cold from the car.<br /><br />Audio quality is fine and the foam earbuds are comfy.<br /><br />Only odd thing that seems to only occur with these earbuds that some might find annoying is: they are very conductive to static electricity.<br /><br />I think that the metal case on them may be in some way grounded to or at least very close to the speaker driver inside.<br />What this means is that if you shift in your seat and are wearing a static jacket or sweater, and are in a low humidity environment, and your phone is plugged into a charger (makes this happen more), you will be zapped in the ears by static electricity and hear a few pops.<br />Your computer monitors may black out for a few seconds when this happens as the interference is enough to disrupt the video signal, despite this happening on your phone and wall charger.<br /><br />I've never had this issue with other metal or plastic earbuds.<br /><br />Despite this I still like the earbuds so will continue to use them until they eventually fail.",0.44495469331741333,0.0,0.5,0.5,0.0

"I ordered this antenna mount to install an outdoor PoE mesh network access point for my Starlink service.  I was looking for a sturdy mount that would hold to the weather.  The Proxicast Pro-Grade J-Max 100% Solid Stainless Steel Antenna Mount more than filled the task.  I chose the stainless steel mount over the aluminum since it was only a few dollars more.  Also, I wanted to increase the height of the mast by adding additional tubing, so the stainless steel should be able to carry any extra weight easily.<br /><br />The mount was straightforward to install.  After installing the base support to the wall, there are only 4 bolts to insert and tighten.  However, a couple of the base's mounting holes are directly behind the J arm.  If you want to use these, you may have to assemble the unit in place rather than on the ground.  The two small bolts holding the arm have to be slid in from the inside to the J arm tube.  It was tricky holding the bolt inside the tube to line it up with the provided hole while standing on a ladder.<br /><br />I have vinyl siding, so I wanted to use the facia board on the soffit.  The base support is a bit large (over 7 inches) and my facia boards are not that wide.  I wound up using a front corner that gave me more surface area.  Since I wanted to add to the mast height by a few feet, I used 1-inch PVC schedule 40 pipe.  That size was almost perfect and slid fairly snuggly into the Proxicast J arm.  I inserted the PVC pipe to the bend in the J-arm and added a few feet of length.  I used 2 additional 1/4-inch bolts to secure the pipe.  All in all, a very solid installation.",0.45001712441444397,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0

"These ear buds are currently priced at less than $20 (1/23). I would hope you understand that quality starts at about $100+ and average/acceptable begins around $50. So, for $20 you are getting something that can charge in its case, connect via Bluetooth, and has a mic...not bad. I do like the display for battery life when you open the case, but I don't like the case itself, it's annoying to open.

"I bought the modem/mesh router combo. The modem and one router works well enough. Setting up an additional router for a mesh network doesn't work.<br /><br />The network is controlled and set up by the ""surfboard"" app. This app seems to be the root of all problems, and possibly all evil in the universe. On a Galaxy S22 Ultra, the app takes over a minute to even turn on. When it does, it usually fails to recognize that it is connected to the network it is supposed to manage, despite the fact that the phone is using that wifi. As a result, you can't make any changes to the network. In the rare instances where it does recognize the connection, it invariably can't successfully navigate through all the steps to get the second satellite connected. After about 50 attempts, I managed to get the second router to successfully mesh. After 2 hours, it inexplicably became disconnected and would never work again.<br /><br />Customer service is completely useless. There's a live chat function that is just permanently unavailable. If you manage to actually find the phone number, which is buried on their website and locked behind a model and SN warranty verification, they are unable to help. After an afternoon trying every version of ""reset it"" known to man, tech support told me to get a replacement from Amazon.<br /><br />I have no reason to believe that a replacement is going to work any better.

"Let me start with the good stuff because I'm that kind of person. This board is easy to install in an 2011 iMac 27 inch case. I drilled some holes in the back of the aluminum chassis for the control buttons, they fit nice and the buttons are flush with the aluminum, it's like they aren't there until you need them, which I think is cool. I would have liked a longer lead between the main board and the backlight control board, it is tight to where the main circuit board mounts nicely on the right side of the iMac case, but it was fine.

The soft case had smudges all over it from coming in contact with hands and contacting and sliding on surfaces.  I will be honest and say that it did not have dust which indicates it was protected from collecting dust in some capacity, or it was simply dusted off prior to being boxed for shipping.  Oh, and yes, its not made in the USA which may explain all this.",0.44913971424102783,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"What do I like? The fact that not only do these earbuds provide absolutely amazing sound (it feels like you're in a live performance because of the separation of the different sounds, so the music feels like it is literally all around you), but, finally, some genius somewhere came up with a comfortable design that actually stay in my ears securely - I am hooked on these earbuds!<br /><br />What don't I like? Well, as with all Apple products, you are supposed to know how to use these right out of the box with minimal instruction.  Yes, I read what there was of the ""user guide"", but I finally had to go online to find out how in the heck to turn the volume up and down - you have to ask Siri!  And my pair came set at an uncomfortably high level of sound, so I was really anxious to know how to accomplish this feat.  There are many different sources to get information online, but for this price you would think they would include instructions for something as vital as controlling the volume.  I don't mind that they can't be charged wirelessly, that for me is not a deal breaker.<br /><br />I will have to say the noise canceling works really, really well - this is my first pair of true noise canceling earbuds - but as a single older female, I'm not sure how much I will use that feature, as I am very aware of my personal security at all times.  It's nice to have, though.  I walked next to my usually noisy furnace while it was running and couldn't hear anything but the music I was listening to - I thought that was awesome.  Amazing what they can do with technology.<br /><br />If you're a really devoted, expert music fan, you might not like these - I read some reviews that complained about various ""defects"" in the sound quality, but my ear isn't educated enough to pick those up, if they are really there.  There is just no pleasing some people at any price point, so I'll take these and be very happy to have them!  They work for me, so that's my main issue right there.  And they stay in my ears!  Oh, one more thing - I started out, as recommended, with the Medium ear tips, but noticed by this morning that my ears were very slightly irritated, so I changed them out for the Small size.  Perfect, with no loss of sound quality.",0.4482742249965668,0.5,0.5,0.0,0.5

"I was in the market for a lightweight laptop to replace a 6-year old 5 lb brick I'd been using for travel and a home entertainment system.

ASUS also appears to dominate the OLED notebook market which gave me more confidence this would be a quality product.<br />Added bonuses on this laptop were the Radeon discrete graphics card (which frees up to 2GB of system memory) , under 3lbs weight and pretty darn good battery life.

In short, I'm very pleased with this laptop and would recommend it to others who are looking for similar criteria.<br />The only cons I can think of: it is so thin it does not come with a built-in external video connector or Ethernet plug. I'll need to get a dock module eventually, since it didn't come with either an HDMI or Ethernet adapter.<br />Great product, it'll be my travelling companion for the next 3-5 years.",0.445095419883728,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
Overall a good product. My only complaint is that doesn‚Äôt change video format to 4:3 for older DVDs automatically. Tries to fit them into the 16:9 format by default which distorts the image when played in a 16:9 TV. I have to change the format on the TV.,0.44742918014526367,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"Great kit from iFixit.  This is the first item I ever bought from them, and I'm not disappointed.  I really just wanted a nice screwdriver with some common bits I could use for phone and computer repair.  I already have a million pry tools lying around from other screen kits and such, but I will say this blue pry tool is the most sturdy one I've ever used.  Very durable and hard plastic.  Yes it will wear down eventually, but not as quickly as the cheap ones if you've ever used them.  Tweezers are also very fine and sharp!  I know because I sliced my thumb up really nice with them! :D  Great item as well!  Tips will bend if you're too harsh on them so just be careful if you're trying to use them as mini ""pliers"".  Suction cup is probably the most sturdy and strong I've ever used too.  The double-suction removal tool they sell is probably more practical, but I have no issue spending the extra 10 seconds holding the device at a certain angle to get the pry tool underneath the screen.  Another fantastic item.  Screwdriver is very sturdy as well, and the bits are very nice and come magnetized!  A wonderful feature after using non-magnetized bits for SO long.  I found that after excessive use the magnets ability will slowly wear away, but one of those magnetizers for bits will make it good as new again.  Black spudger tool is very nice too, I find it very handy in certain situations, and once again, it seems to be better quality than the other cheap ones you can find in repair kits.  Overall, iFixit takes what was good in repair tools, and upgrades the quality by 10x.  To say I'm paying for the name is probably fair.  This kit could easily be $19.99.  But for the quality and brands reputation, I'd say I made a great decision going with this kit.  Repairs iPhones, Samsungs, Computers, Controllers.

"Easy to pair, very simple operation, and shockingly good sound from such a small package.  As an owner of a Marshall amp, the Action III has the same aesthetics with the gold face and knobs, the vintage grille cloth, and the thick heavy cabinet.  It even has a little something that their amps don't.  Instead of a line on the bass, treble, and volume knobs that displays the level, the Action III has LEDs around the knobs which light up as you move clockwise.  It's smaller than a shoebox and my fingertips reach around the top, but it's difficult to pick up one handed due to its weight.  You're not going to accidentally knock it off of your table or counter without some effort.<br /><br />This speaker is not rechargeable.  It‚Äôs powered by an AC cord.  This may be a disadvantage to some because you won‚Äôt be taking it on a picnic unless an outlet is nearby.  Your device will recognize the available connection as Action III.  If you know the functions of bass, treble, and volume, you've got it mastered.  It doesn't get any easier.  Being an AC powered unit, it does appear to play considerably louder than a rechargeable speaker.  It has excellent bass and crystal clear highs coming from twin tweeters.  The midrange seems to be just a bit subdued.  That's personally just how I like it, but an extra tone or contour control like the ones you find on Marshall amps would be a plus for some listeners.  I‚Äôve yet to experience any issues with static and I rate it five stars based on its tone and cool looks.",0.4486802816390991,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5

I had to make some adjustments, so it wouldn‚Äôt be sliding off my face while I slept, which is annoying but not manageable. However, that‚Äôs not the biggest problem, after a week of using it, I‚Äôve learned that the battery does not last 12 hours like it says. I maybe get eight hours out of a full battery if I‚Äôm lucky. It‚Äôs shutting off before I am meant to get up which is actually disrupting my sleep. I‚Äôve only had it for a week so the fact it‚Äôs not even giving me eight hours of battery life is unacceptable.

"I love OBSBOT products. I own three cameras all together going back no just over two years, and all three are excellent and dependable.<br /><br />Most importantly, the software you can get from OBSBOT (simply called OBSBOT Webcam which replaces their earlier software called Tinycam) has vastly improved over the last year or so, to the point I consider it an absolute must for these cameras (but it doesn't slow down, crash, or otherwise behave funny in Windows 10 or 11).<br /><br />You can also get an affordable remote which I have as well, and it works too -<br /><br />I've used, since the pandemic began, well over a dozen total webcams from different manufacturers. These include bigger names like Logitech, Wirestorm, Yealink, and Boom, and many lesser known brands (some of which have been alright!). Overall, I consider OBSBOT my favorite. All manufacturers of dedicated Webcams seem to ""create"" a unique look and have their own standard for contrast, brightness, sharpness, and so forth. My impression of OBSBOT is that it's not heavy handed one way or the other, but does have an overall darker exposure than many if not most. So, you may have to tweak your setting in your software that uses the webcam (like Zoom, Teams, etc) or use the OBSBOT Webcam software for that which works well. I like that it doesn't try too hard to make things overly bright and ""beautiful"" by making my face look plastic and overly smooth like some seem to do.<br /><br />I would not say the picture quality is astonishing - but excellent for a webcam. Frankly, I think Logitech has picture quality dialed pretty good, if that's the MOST important aspect - but for the price you basically can't beat it if PTZ is a must for you (it really is for me). The software makes controlling the camera even during meetings a breeze. And, yes, you can create and save fixed angle/zoom/tilt in the software (but it'll have to be running in the background to work reliably in your app of choice).<br /><br />Also, while you don't see a ""privacy cover"" that's easy - tilt the lens down towards the main body and poof, you've put it to sleep. While not as reliable as a hard cover, it works just fine (just know that if you click to turn on your camera in say Zoom, it'll turn the camera on or wake it). You can also tell it to go to sleep in the app including how long to stay on if not in use.<br /><br />Comes with a very nice, and I mean VERY nice zippered case that'll hold everything but the little tripod it comes with. I don't use the tripod but do have many other much taller/bigger tripods I do use with it. I've never actually used the monitor mount but it's quite strong and functional too (I just prefer stands or tripods for control).<br /><br />Finally, the internal microphone is legions better than most webcam microphones. Seriously. As in, actually dependable and usable. That said, I almost never use it as I have multiple dedicated microphones I prefer to use. But, it really is usable compared to nearly every other built-in webcam mic I've every tried - so if that's important to you, know that the microphone is fine (but built-in webcam microphones simply won't ever improve on dedicated high-quality microphones made for personal or conference room use in my opinion).<br /><br />One big selling point with OBSBOT is the gesture control. Sorry, I don't use it. I love this camera for the quality it has in the optics, PTZ control, and software. That said, the gestures do work and work as advertised (yes, I've tried them - they're just not my thing).<br /><br />If you need a very good 4K PTZ webcam at a great price - even for a high quality conference room set up - you should consider OBSBOT.",0.44375303387641907,0.5,0.0,0.5,0.5

"I paid full price for the Amazon fabric case for my Kindle Scribe after trying out a cheap plasticky case and being disappointed in how it looked and functioned. But those were early days for the Scribe and new cases are popping up much more frequently.<br /><br />That leads me to this case. I did not need another Scribe case but this one intrigued me not only because of the fun colors but because of a different approach to the stand and pen holder than the other cheaper case I'd tried or the Amazon case.  What I love about the Amazon case is that it's thin and can prop up the reader for hands-free use.  I also love that the flap attaches magnetically to the back of the case when you're holding it in your hands.  But what I hate about the case is that you really have to pay attention to how you pick it up and open it.  I've dropped the Scribe twice, once trying to remove it and the second time simply opening the case.  There isn't anything holding it in place but magnets so if you detach them just right it comes a house of cards that instantly falls apart.<br /><br />This case addresses all of those shortcomings.  It places the Scribe inside the case and all sides are well-covered so it won't fall out accidentally.  The pen holder is on the side where I'm used to pen holders being on e-ink note-taking devices.  And most importantly, it also props up the reader for hands-free use and the flap also attaches magnetically to the back of the case when you're holding it.  There is even a little slot to stick your hand to make it less likely that you'll drop it. I love this case and it is replacing my Amazon case.  It isn't perfect; the front flap can shift a little and the hand grip could be a little bigger.  But these aren't deal breakers for me.<br /><br />Now, I will say that there is still a place for the Amazon case.  If you prefer that your cases be as slim as possible, do know that this one is thicker and heavier than the Amazon case.  But if you're OK with a little extra girth, I think this case is great and is priced very nicely for what you get.",0.4475979506969452,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.5

"I have difficulty sleeping when there‚Äôs ambient noise of any kind, so I wanted a way to lie down without losing my headphones. This offered a unique solution.<br /><br />The headband is made from a quite comfortable mesh material that stays in place even while lying down. The earbuds offer some flexibility to ensure they match your ears. They‚Äôre not sewn in place. I prefer to lie on my side, and the earbuds don‚Äôt impede this in any way. I almost don‚Äôt even notice they‚Äôre there.<br /><br />They sound superb for their size as well and are able to block out a substantial amount of noise. The earbuds can be removed for when you need to wash the headband.<br /><br />Pairing the headphones with your device is super easy, and the battery life is also surprisingly good for the size of the product. I haven‚Äôt had to recharge it in over a week of use. I haven‚Äôt really used the controls on the front besides turning the headphones on and off, but the buttons are easy enough to identify without looking at them.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great solution for those who are looking for a way to play music or sleep sounds without losing their headphones somewhere in the bed sheets.",0.44336602091789246,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

"Having used a number of light sets, I have to say this one stands out above the others for a number of reasons.  Starting with the tripods, the construction is superior over any similar priced devices.  Instead of rivets, each joint is connected with screws and nylon locking nuts and when opening and closing the tripod base, it feels surprisingly precise.  The locking knobs are large and tighten in one-half turn.  The tubes extended stiffly at first but became smoother with use and when extended at a measured maximum height of 52‚Äù.  With the light and a phone attached, the unit remained stable.<br /><br />Included in the light set are two sets of 9 colored filters, that can be slipped into a filter slot on the front of each light.  The lights are powered via a standard a 5v USB power supply and can be used anywhere you want by powering them using a portable standard phone power pack.  Lighting intensity is adjusted using up/down buttons located on the on/off switch and I found battery power consumption to be modest even at the highest lighting settings.  (I am using a 20,000 mAh power pack)<br /><br />Also included in the set are two phone holders that can be attached to the uprights.  They worked well and kept my iPhone 13 tightly secured.  In addition, two, 360-degree ball-head camera mounts are included allowing the lights to be aimed in any direction.<br /><br />Final thoughts:  This is a pretty amazing set of lights for the price.  The set includes two sets of 9 colored filters, quality constructed tripods, two ball-head camera mounts, two phone holders and two 1000 lumen LED lights, (not measured), adjustable from 10-100% intensity, and a working height from 17‚Äù to 52‚Äù!  I wish a carry bag was included, but I‚Äôm not going to knock the manufacturer as they have provided a quality system at a low price.",0.45130348205566406,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0

After charging overnight, it's been on for about 3 hours now and still has about 30% battery left.

The rest of the installation was easy. NO instructions at all, so you are on your own. Just do an internet search for how to do it.<br /><br />The hardest part was figuring out if this was the right battery because there are many model numbers for the same battery, and many laptop models that it fits into. My laptop model was not on the list (probably too old) but I went by the size and shape of the battery, and it fit.<br /><br />Be sure to properly recycle your old battery.

This USB-C to Apple connector cable works great on the iPhone 7.  Both connectors plug in securely and it charges quickly.  The cable has a braided exterior that is tightly wrapped to the cord insulation.  It does not slide around or kink.  The cord is still flexible and can be folded and tied together if necessary.  The cable comes with a nylon strap that can be used to secure a bundle.  Its a nice cable and it has been working well in our living room and the cable is long enough to use the phone on the sofa while it is charging.,0.4496746361255646,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Batteries charged overnight without issue using a spare USB plug adapter I had handy (I assume charge of 3 batteries would take forever using a standard computer USB port).  The batteries fit the camera and appear to work just fine.  The batteries claim 1800mah, original is 1720mah, so they should last as long as the oem versions, but I won't hold my breath based on other reviews...however, only time will tell.  The charger makes a nice carrying case for the batteries.<br /><br />So far, I am happy with the batteries and charger.

Say bye to paper towel with isopropyl alcohol , or isopropyl alcohol lens wipes that takes 2-3 minutes and 3+ wipes to get off.

The smell is worth the ease for removing old/preapplied paste.<br /><br />Can't really say how much better this paste is than my old corsair tm-30 paste since I did upgrade from a 240mm aio to a 360. But its thermal paste, just works. Does seem to be high quality stuff, a little viscous but still easy to work with and not a headache.

"I have the glorious gmmk pro 75% keyboard with the lynx linear switches. I wanted shine through key caps which is why I went with the razer lime green ones as well as the razer phantom key caps for the keys I didn‚Äôt use much and didn‚Äôt care to see. My favorite colors are green and black obviously. I thought these would be a nice accent for my keyboard. I went with the green ones, and I love them! I thought they would‚Äôve been more on the lime side like the picture but I actually don‚Äôt mind the darker green. They feel smooth on my fingers and sound great on my switches. The back space on my keyboard sounded weird so I decided not to put it on there. I do really wish I could‚Äôve changed my space bar but no other space bars I tried work on my keyboard for some reason. So the black phantom keycap will stay.

"VENTION Wireless Earbuds Bluetooth 5.3 Headphones Call Noise Reduction Ear Buds with Charging Case come in a sleek looking package. The earbuds are very difficult to get out of the charging case as they are slippery hard plastic and held in the case by magnets. The sound is shrill and lacking low end bass notes. For music these would be tiring to listen to for a long time and the sound quality is much less than other earbuds I have used. The non-contact buttons get pressed too easily and make the phone go into modes you do not want to be in.

"I am a frequent user of canned air and living in the Southwest I try to have a can of canned air at the ready all the time.  Since I use canned air all the time replacing them has become an expense I have started to really notice and I needed to find a way to cut back (financially) but I still need to be able to dust and clean things when necessary.  I have done some research on several of these cordless, compressed air dusters and this one really stood out from all the others.  The first and most important was its powerful 110000RPM capable motor.  This allows for air flow much higher than most of the other units on the market and allows for cleaning in between keyboard keys, dusting off motherboard fans and general daily maintenance of most products.  Secondly, is the 7800mAh battery which allows me to charge this unit up and it can hold charge (for my use) for weeks before I need to recharge it.  It has three speeds and a light at the from that helps when cleaning things in dark spaces.

(A BNC male to dual binding post adapter helps.)  The battery holds a good charge, delivering at least overnight listening, and charges quickly from a USB outlet.

When I saw this one, I ordered immediately as it was exactly what I was looking for. This comes with ann application frame that makes it so easy to apply the screen protector perfectly straight on the iPad. Without the frame, it can be difficult to get the screen protector positioned correctly and bubbles can form if it is not applied smoothly. The frame holds the screen protector in place while you align it and then you just press it down onto the screen.

"[[VIDEOID:5be99a112b58fea85ee9ed1ef694bfc6]] This review is for the NEWCARE HDMI 2.1 4x1 switch, which allows a single HDMI 2.1 input on a TV or monitor to easily switch between up to four HDMI sources, such as computers, game consoles, set-top boxes, etc. In terms of behavior, the active input is electronically coupled to the output while the others are in a disconnected state. Every time you switch inputs, the link needs to be re-trained, so it will take a few seconds for the picture to appear and stabilize. Overall, this product is easy to set up and works as expected. Besides switching capabilities, a secondary benefit of this product is that it effectively works as an extender, allowing you to get two HDMI cables worth of length.<br /><br />I tested the NEWCARE HDMI 2.1 switch with a 4K@144Hz [[ASIN:B09885HV8C gaming monitor]], an [[ASIN:B0BP4XWWXL Windows 11 laptop]] with integrated Radeon 680M graphics, and a [[ASIN:B0B57T77H3 USB-C to HDMI 2.1 adapter]]. With this configuration, I could utilize the gaming monitor's full capabilities, verifying that HDMI 2.1 FRL signaling was indeed supported. I also connected a few HDMI 2.0b devices and was able to switch between the inputs without drama.<br /><br />The NEWCARE HDMI 2.1 switch also features an IR remote control, and it comes with an optional IR receiver just in case this switch is hidden inside a media cabinet, etc. The product is USB-powered using the included USB-A to barrel connector cable, and with a rated power consumption of only 3W, a TV or game console's USB port can easily power it. This product does not come with any HDMI cables.<br /><br />Notes:<br />1) The switching button is a clicky mechanical type that's satisfying to press. The indicator LEDs are blue and they are thankfully not very bright.",0.44711822271347046,0.5,0.5,0.0,0.5

"Someone gave me an older but unused GoPro 3+ Black edition with only one battery. I knew that I would be needing more from my drone experieces so after reading reviews I settled on these Wasabi batteries and have not been disappointed at all. Slightly more watthours so they last a bit longer, no heating up, fit my GoPro just fine and the price is exceptional. I have always trusted Japanese engineering and these are no exception.

Feels like a quality cable - works well. I needed to move my equipment to a hidden closet. This helped make the connection to my subwoofer from the new location.
