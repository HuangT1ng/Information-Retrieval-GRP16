06-01-2023 23:33:39,"tessan may not be a brand you've heard of but i can assure you this product is well-made and works perfectly. years ago, i purchased a lower-quality plug adapter which worked, but felt cheap and had a rubberized coating that is now weirdly sticky. the build quality of the tessan is superior and the prongs for europe (in this case italy) protrude farther, making a better connection. see my photos for three different applications -- all in italy. the photos show a hotel room, train armrest, and delta airlines flight (premium select on a boeing -er layout as shown on seatguru). i realize that the adapter wasn't necessary on the plane & train due to the plane's universal receptacle, but i wanted you to see the photo anyway to illustrate what it would look like if needed. it's important to note that when you move the slider that corresponds to the country you're adapting to, you have to:. push the slider knob in. then slide it across to make the prongs extend. then keep pressing until it moves to the very end of the slot. then slide it even a little more until you feel the spring-loaded knob lock into place and ""snap out"" a littleif you don't lock the knob, the adapter's prongs will retract back into the body when you try to plug it into the wall and you'll think it's a piece of junk. i promise you it's not junk if you use it correctly. it has universal international receptacles to accept all plug types from your home country. it also has four usb-a ports on the bottom for charging phones, tablets, etc. it's great because you don't need to rely on the little while cube for your iphone (or whatever samsungs come with). just plug the usb cable right into this adapter. important: keep in mind this is not a voltage converter. it only *adapts* the shape of the plug's prongs for devices that can run on - volts -- such as most laptop chargers, phone/tablet chargers, etc. don't try to plug a u. s. hair dryer into this adapter in europe (or anywhere with - volts). you'll destroy the device and possibly cause a fire. for that application, you'd need a voltage converter.",tessan may not brand heard assure product well-made work perfectly year ago purchased lower-quality plug adapter worked felt cheap rubberized coating weirdly sticky build quality tessan superior prong europe case italy protrude farther making better connection see photo three different application italy photo show hotel room train armrest delta airline flight premium select boeing er layout shown seatguru realize adapter not necessary plane train due plane universal receptacle wanted see photo anyway illustrate would look like needed important note move slider corresponds country adapting push slider knob slide across make prong extend keep pressing move end slot slide even little feel spring-loaded knob lock place snap littleif not lock knob adapter prong retract back body try plug wall think piece junk promise not junk use correctly universal international receptacle accept plug type home country also four usb-a port bottom charging phone tablet etc great not need rely little cube iphone whatever samsungs come plug usb cable right adapter important keep mind not voltage converter adapts shape plug prong device run volt laptop charger phone/tablet charger etc not try plug hair dryer adapter europe anywhere volt destroy device possibly fire application would need voltage converter,5,1,1,1,1

09-01-2023 17:50:07,"im actually writing this review with this keyboard case. i have used many keyboards for my ipads over the years. even an apple magic keyboard clone. now do not get me wrong that clone is actually pretty decent but my biggest issue was i had to take my ipad out of its case to put it in my stand for night time bedside use. with this i can leave my ipad inside its case and just remove the keyboard. my only issue was where do i put the keyboard when im not using it. i then realized my ipad cary case was perfect so that is solved. now this is not all perfect, one is the issues that the magic keyboard case solves is its an all in one so it works fine in the lap. this does also but it requires a little more leg to keep the whole thing together as the kick stand in the back needs that extra support. it could have had a web or a double fold behind it to help with that but it does work and you can get use to that addition. the keyboard is easy to add and easy to take off. it has a row of functions excluded with the magic keyboard and are sadly missed by me now that i have used this. th keys have a good tactile feel and make a nice clacking sound that is not too loud just enough movement and sound to give you feedback that you pressed a key. i have so far not had any missed keys while typing. so any typos you catch in this review are not because of a key that didn't work it was the operator. it's nice to have a full functioning keyboard with all the necessary keys to keep my fingers off the screen. gives me an almost laptop feel with this keyboard. now to the design its thick and rigid and the keyboard has a small amount of flex but does not feel like its going to fold. the track pad takes a little getting use to as you have to press in the center to get it to respond might be how the ipad handles a track pad. i had the same issue with the other keyboard. the on off switch is sold and moves easily into place and it uses usb-c which for me is a plus. the only thing i think they could have worked better on was the cover for the switch and usb-c. they could have omitted the cover and put the switch on the top side of the keyboard and had the usb-c exposed and not have left this little floppy piece hanging on the side if not re plugged back into the usb-c spot. the cut out for the camera is ample for the ipad or and should be fine for the ipad pro (hopefully as that is next on my list) it has a flap that flips over to help hold the keyboard in place. and overall it has a look of fabric which has a grippy texture . there is an included sticker on the keyboard i removed and put on a black background (it has tips i could not read till it was put on a black background which fixed the aforementioned issue i had with the trackpad. image left in this review. this a a decent offering and one i am pleased to be using with this ipad and my next ipad. pros: keyboard with short cut keys needed on the magic keyboards. easy to remove and replace keyboardbuilt in kickstandusb-c charging. space for apple pencil (and it still charges)cons: cover for charging and usb-c feels like an afterthought. no way to reverse hold keyboard for when

01-01-2023 21:13:22,"i am on ybp # and at this point no longer comfortable using this in a professional setting. the first four ybp that i received were defective—two from amazon and two from yololiv. i have tried posting these comments on yololiv's facebook forum. their admins deleted it and banned me from the group. i am leaving this here to show my experience with yololiv as an example of what could happen to anyone. to yololiv's credit, they did attempt to replace the initial defective unit and in the end, did replace it with a functional device, albeit seven weeks after starting the warranty process with four defective units received in a row. seven weeks is a very long time to wait when the device is not a toy or something inexpensive, but that's just my opinion. ybp # was purchased on amazon. # was defective and sent back to mfg. # was sent to me by mfg. # was sent by mfg. # was purchased on amazon. # was sent by mfg. ybp # would send video to zoom but no audio. factory resets did nothing. tested on multiple machines and operating systems. battery would last maybe an hour, not the advertised four hours. purchased from official yololiv store on amazon as brand new. ybp # was a replacement from factory. they sent me a used device that had loose usb ports—i sent it back. ybp # was a replacement from factory. brand new and unopened. this had hdmi- port issues where the device kept trying to load hdmi- with nothing connected. factory resets did nothing. ybp # had an unusual bright spot on the screen—about the size of an eraser head. this portion of the screen was very bright, much brighter than the rest of the screen, and clearly seen when on a white background. purchased from official yololiv store on amazon. ybp # is a replacement from factory. supposedly is brand new and “opened for testing”, this unit appears to function properly. no way to tell if it's a new or another refurbished device. i am uncomfortable using this on a paid event and i have only done small tests at home. my experience with ybp having read their official forum for several weeks, is that ybp may work for some, but it appears to not work for many, and overall, it definitely has not worked for me. go see for yourself—official yololiv on facebook. many people are complaining about a myriad of problems, many of which i encountered, and some that i had yet to encounter. the warranty replacement process took about a month and a half of emails (many of which were not responded to by support), which led to lots of frustration, spending money on shipping to send back defective products, and a lot of uncertainty in if i had just wasted over a thousand dollars on a brick that was no longer in my possession. i went several weeks with no product and little to no communication, after sending my original and all of the defective replacements back to the manufacturer. the ridiculous, and to be honest rather insulting part of all of this, support said they would replace my defective device only if i would praise them on social media for being an amazing company and their rep supposedly had to get special managerial approval to do this—as if they're doing me a huge favor by replacing my defective device with a functioning unit when it is well within warranty period. yololiv should replace my defective device because it is defective, not because i am bribing them with potential accolades. bad form, hook. in my opinion, the only acceptable response to this level of problem is, sorry for the inconvenience, here's a brand new device. out of the few multicam streams i did, one of them, ybp crashed mid performance. a different stream dropped frames when on faster upload than outgoing bitrate via ethernet. another stream had audio issues where it was cutting out. only one stream seemed to work fine out of all of the streams that i did, and it was a single camera sitting at the back of the room connected to wifi where the router was on another floor of the building. lol. my experience is that i wasted money to be a beta tester of a product when i was under the impression from several different youtube personalities who are not sponsored by yololiv that this was a solid and tested device. had i known about and seen their facebook forum before purchasing, i would have not purchased and ran screaming for the hills. perfect stereotypical example of, if a customer is treated well, they might tell a few friends but if a customer is disappointed, they will tell as many people who will listen.",ybp point no longer

(all software is up to date.) every now and then there's an issue with the volume where it's very distorted and tinny and almost impossible to hear even at the highest level. i have to unplug the tv and manually reset it to get the audio working again. other times there will be what seems to be some remote communication issues. when trying to use the remote there will be an extremely long delay and it doesn't react at all…just when you think the tv is frozen and get up to unplug it the remote will suddenly receive all of the commands you tried to give it and go berserk. i tried searching the reset/restart issue and discovered many others have the same issue, but could not find a solution. it's priced well and picture quality is good but it can also be extremely frustrating.",purchased tv christmas year son room not getting used often not aware issue since moved common area month getting used often discovered multiple issue reset multiple time day mid show switch black screen say firetv loading dot sometimes second time minute end back select profile screen go back app find show watching hope not sometimes multiple time day sometimes skip day two software date every issue volume distorted tinny almost impossible hear even highest level unplug tv manually reset get audio working time seems remote communication issue trying use remote extremely long delay not react all…just think tv frozen get unplug remote suddenly receive command tried give go berserk tried searching reset/restart issue discovered many others issue could not find solution priced well picture quality good also extremely frustrating,2,1,0,1,0

01-01-2023 21:32:33,"video and photos will be added soon!a quick note on color changing: if you are like me, and just want a single solid color with no marquee effects, here are the steps to get that (took me a few minutes to figure it out as there are no instructions): . hold and press the ""m"" button for - seconds to reset the colors back to the original first setting. . press the ""m"" key times to get to the single color mode. note: when you get here it will initially cycle through all the colors. . press the ""c"" key to activate the color lock feature. . press the ""m"" key until you get to your desired color. that's it!now for the review. i have a razer blade pro that i have been looking to keep cooler overall (knock on wood, i have had no issues others seem to face with this machine).after browsing through cooling pad options i stumbled on this pad, and liked the concept, and the light band (i usually am usually in my office which is dark or dimly lit so some soft lights are always welcome) so i thought i would give this one s try. there are other brands here that provide the same exact product, but this one i could get same day as opposed to two days, so i decided on this one. ordered at am and had it in hand before pm, not bad. everything was packaged very well, not rattles or anything from the box before opening. the cooling pad was in the protective plastic sleeve, and the power adaptor was separately wrapped in it's own plastic. this is a good time for me to note that this unit does not plug into your laptop's usb ports. it has an ac adaptor that must be plugged into the wall. the cord is about - feet long (estimating) and i had no issues with the cord length being too short. the foam pad is perforated so you can remove the inner band to accommodate larger laptops, which i had to do. the foam is very soft and high quality, and even after being compressed between the lid and bottom of the box, the crease that resulted was gone within a couple of minutes. the base portion with the fan has magnets that connect with the metal discs on the underside of the foam to hold it in place. initially of the magnets fell off the base due to poor adhesive, but a little dab of super glue on each solved that easily. once i was able to get the color band the way i wanted it per the instructions above i decided to take it for a whirl. it's nice that once you get the desired light effect the settings are saved when you power the pad on and off. yay! you don't have to do all that work over again. note: i didn't do extensive benchmarking i just monitored my cpu and gpu temps under my typical workloads. without the pad i my cpu typically runs between: - degrees (centigrade) when idling or under light load, and between - degrees under a heavier load or during an extended gaming session. the gpu usually runs - degrees at idle/low load and - degrees under heavier loads or while gaming. after adding the pad i notices a drastic reduction in temperatures which really surprised me. at an idle or under a light load my cpu and gpu temps range between - degrees, and when gaming or under heavy load the cpu ranges between - degrees while my gpu ranges between - degrees. much better results than what i was expecting, and i don't even run it over about half way up where i was able to tolerate the white noise and get the performance i wanted. if you turn this thing all the way up it is loud, and you will likely have to use headphones or something to distract you from the noise. i only use it at about half of the max fan speed and am happy there. i can do whatever i need to without getting blown out by the noise, and if i have itunes or netflix on my second monitor, i don't have to increase the volume higher than normal. overall i am very happy with this thing initially, and we will see how it holds up. i would recommend to anyone looking to add some serious cooling to their laptop. i wouldn't recommend it for portable use as it is quite bulky and is dependent on ac power. i am still looking for a portable cooling pad for on-the-go use.",video photo added soon quick note color changing like want single solid color no marquee effect step get took minute figure no instruction hold press button second reset color back original first setting press key time get single color mode note get initially cycle color press key activate color lock feature press key get desired color review razer blade pro looking keep cooler overall knock wood no issue others seem face machine after browsing cooling pad option stumbled pad liked concept light band usually usually office dark dimly lit soft light always welcome thought would give one try brand provide exact product one could get day opposed two day decided one ordered hand pm not bad everything packaged well not rattle anything box opening cooling pad protective plastic sleeve power adaptor separately wrapped plastic good time note unit not plug laptop usb port ac adaptor must plugged wall cord foot long estimating no issue cord length short foam pad perforated remove inner band accommodate larger laptop foam soft high quality even compressed lid bottom box crease resulted gone within couple minute base portion fan magnet connect metal disc underside foam hold place initially magnet fell base due poor adhesive little dab super glue solved easily able get color band way wanted per instruction decided take whirl nice get desired light effect setting saved power pad yay not work note not extensive benchmarking monitored cpu gpu temp typical workload without pad cpu typically run degree centigrade idling light load degree heavier load extended gaming session gpu usually run degree idle/low load degree heavier load gaming adding pad notice drastic reduction temperature really surprised idle light load cpu gpu temp range degree gaming heavy load cpu range degree gpu range degree much better result expecting not even run half way able tolerate white noise get performance wanted turn thing way loud likely use headphone something distract noise use half max fan speed happy whatever need without getting blown noise itunes netflix second monitor not increase volume higher normal overall happy thing initially see hold would recommend anyone looking add serious cooling laptop would not recommend portable use quite bulky dependent ac power still looking portable cooling pad on-the-go use,5,1,1,1,0

09-01-2023 23:15:12,"welcome to this review which is currently being composed by typing on this awesome new keyboard! this is my new “go-to” bluetooth keyboard of choice to use with my macbook pro laptop, and i must say, “i'm impressed!” personally, i do not like using the keyboard on the laptop itself because i want to keep it in “like new” condition and free of oil and other residue for resale when i decide to upgrade to a new laptop, so i chose this keyboard as the new substitute to replace my old worn out apple keyboard. in addition to the fact that it is pretty much exactly like my old apple keyboard, the biggest factor influencing the choice was the backlit keys which i really love! there are many colors to choose from as well as brightness levels which can be changed using a couple of different keys at the top of the keyboard. the unit is mostly silver aluminum metal just like its apple predecessor, and the look and “typing feel” of the keys is very similar. there is also an on/off switch at the top left which is a nice feature as well for preserving the battery life when the unit is not in use. connecting to my macos laptop was a breeze simply by following the instructions in the owner's manual that came with the unit. also included is a usb-a to usb-c charging cord but no power brick. the bottom line is that this keyboard is a very high quality product from a to z in my opinion. it is a substantial weight (due to its mostly metal construction) that does not slide around on the desk while using it, the keys feel just like the much more expensive apple competitor, and it comes equipped with the multi-color brightness selectable backlight. from my perspective, it is absolutely a “no brainer” if you are looking for a less expensive high quality keyboard, so i would not hesitate to recommend it!",welcome review currently composed typing awesome new keyboard new go-to bluetooth keyboard choice use macbook pro laptop must say impressed personally not like using keyboard laptop want keep like new condition free oil residue resale decide upgrade new laptop chose keyboard new substitute replace old worn apple keyboard addition fact pretty much exactly like old apple keyboard biggest factor influencing choice backlit key really love many color choose well brightness level changed using couple different key top keyboard unit mostly silver aluminum metal like apple predecessor look typing feel key similar also on/off switch top left nice feature well preserving battery life unit not use connecting macos laptop breeze simply following instruction owner manual came unit also included usb-a usb-c charging cord no power brick bottom line keyboard high quality product opinion substantial weight due mostly metal construction not slide around desk using key feel like much expensive apple competitor come equipped multi-color brightness selectable backlight perspective absolutely no brainer looking less expensive high quality keyboard would not hesitate recommend,5,1,1,1,1
